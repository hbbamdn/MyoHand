LeapC Python Bindings
=====================

This is the Python LeapC API Wrapper that allows you to interface with Gemini Hand Tracking through python.

A built shared object is required to make use of this. This is included in the Gemini Hand Tracking install from v5.17 
onwards. However, you can manually build this if it does not include a shared object for your python version or 
architecture. Please view the readme of the `leapc-cffi` module on how to build this manually.
